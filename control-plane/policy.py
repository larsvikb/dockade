"""Policy matching — what a stored rule means, and what a host decides to.

Every function here is a pure reading of the rules table: ``_decide`` answers
allow/deny/hold for a host, and the rest exist so that nothing else has to
re-derive what a pattern matches. That is the point of the module — a leading
dot is a subdomain wildcard, and the two places that must agree about it (the
matcher and the patterns an operator may persist) are written side by side so
they cannot drift.

    while looking like an ordinary hostname: a rule persisted for ``.example.com``
    also grants every subdomain, and nothing in the approval flow says so (the
    pattern comes verbatim from the requested host — see the rule-management item in
    DESIGN.md). Naming the scope is the cheap half of that fix."""

    Exists because ``resolve`` used to store the requested host verbatim. Two facts
    made that sharper than it looks: a leading dot is a subdomain wildcard (``_match``),
    and the host on an approval is chosen by the AGENT — so a request for
    ``.example.com`` persisted a rule covering every subdomain of example.com, and
    nothing in this system revokes a rule. Deriving the candidate set here, in the
    module that defines matching, makes exact-vs-wildcard an *operator choice from a
    bounded set* instead of a string the requester supplies.

    Three at most, in increasing order of breadth — so the first is both the safest and
    the default:

      - the exact host;
      - ``.host`` — that host and its subdomains;
      - ``.<last two labels>`` — the registrable domain, which is what an operator
        usually wants when one service spreads over many hostnames.

    Anything broader is deliberately NOT offered: it needs direct policy editing, which
    is a decision rather than a click.

    Known limitation, stated rather than hidden: with no public-suffix list the
    two-label suffix of ``example.co.uk`` is ``.co.uk``, which grants far more than it
    appears to. That is why the UI shows the chosen pattern VERBATIM in a confirm step
    instead of describing it, and why a human picks."""
